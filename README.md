"A leetcode problem problem a day keeps the interview and DSA demons away" - A random Indian youtuber with more than a million followers.
Trying to develop algorithmic thinking (which I guess I won't be using most of the time) and to board the FOMO train and mainly to impress a few recruiters (if at all they see this lol) and create FOMO for fellow strangers (doing an evil laugh...)
